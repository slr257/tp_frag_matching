# tp_frag_matching
R Workflow for matching predicted fragments for MP biotransformation products to measured HRMS data

This workflow is consists of 8 steps for the processing of high-resolution mass spectrometry data to match predicted and matching fragments

## Step 1: Begin by clearing the workspace and installing required R packages

## Step 2: Upload required data into working directory
### long reports (excel), mxXML files, and a database of in-silico predicted fragments (excel) files are needed

## Step 3: Define functions used for organizing MS2 data and long reports with sample names

## Step 4: Begin setting up loops  for analysis - one for TPs and one for samples

## Step 5: Preallocate resulting dataframes (sam.df and frags.df)

## Step 6: Run fragment-matching for-loop

## Step 7: Export results as csv files

## Step 8: Export results as a formatted Excel Workbook
